**SCENARIO**

You work at La Poule Qui Chante, a French food company. She wants to expand internationally. Therefore they need an analysis mission for the international launch.

International, yes, but for the moment, the field of possibilities is very wide: no particular country or continent has been chosen for the moment. 

All countries are possible!

**THE DATA**

You have access to this data, extracted directly from the company's database to CSV files. Here are the files at your disposal:

•	DisponibiliteAlimentaire_2017

•	Population_2000_2018.

In addition the data are available on the FAO website at http://www.fao.org/faostat/fr/#data .

Based on the needs expressed below in this statement, it will be up to you to choose which data to download.

**SKILLS ASSESSED**

•	Perform a PCA

•	Perform simple clustering (hierarchical classification, kmeans classification)

•	Explore data to synthesize variables

•	Creation of a heatmap

**YOUR MISSIONS**

•	the PESTEL analysis

•	to offer an initial analysis of the groupings of countries that we can target to export company’s products:
      o	to test the ascending hierarchical classification, with a dendrogram as a visualization. 

      o	to use the k-means method to refine the analysis and compare the results of the two clustering methods. Do not hesitate to take the time to analyse the centroids of your classes. 

      o	carry out a PCA in order to visualize the results of your analysis, understand the groups, the links between the variables, the links between the individuals...

•	a heatmap with the intersections between the clusters of countries and the different variables (in image format), so that I can immediately get an idea of the different groups that you will have defined.
